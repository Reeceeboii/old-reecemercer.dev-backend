# [old] reecemercer.dev-backend

This was the backend for my old personal websites, written using NodeJS utilising the Express.js server framework. It was responsible for dynamic content served on my old personal and photography websites. It provided integrations to a MongoDB instance and an Amazon Web Services S3 Bucket such that the frontends of these two sites could easily have access to the data they need.

This server and all of its functionality has been replaced with my new backend, written in Go.
